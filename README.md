Our projects population script is there, however it doesn't run properly and we didn't have enough time to figure out why. 

This is our best attempt at this project. Being students, we struggled a lot with the timing issues of the deadline and also with none of us having any previous experience of git, django, html, bootstrap... it meant it was a slow process in trying to get things done, and error fixing took much longer than it needed to, due to us not really having a full working understanding of the code. This means our project is not fully finished, however we would have loved the time to make it work 100% as it was a really interesting specification.
